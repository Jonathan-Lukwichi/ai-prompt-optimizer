## 🤖 Auto-Detection Examples

Quick Mode uses AI to automatically detect what you need:

### Example 1: Machine Learning Beginner
**Your Prompt:**
```
"What is a neural network and how does it work?"
```

**Auto-Detected:**
- Domain: ML/Data Science
- Role: Student
- Task: Learning
- Best Version: **Tutor Mode** (Socratic questioning)

**Why:** Uses learning keywords ("what is", "how does") in ML context

---

### Example 2: Python Developer
**Your Prompt:**
```
"My Python code throws TypeError when I try to concatenate string and int"
```

**Auto-Detected:**
- Domain: Python Development
- Role: Developer
- Task: Debugging
- Best Version: **Basic Mode** (clear problem-solving)

**Why:** Contains "Python", "code", "error", "TypeError"

---

### Example 3: Academic Researcher
**Your Prompt:**
```
"I need recent research papers on climate change impacts on agriculture"
```

**Auto-Detected:**
- Domain: Academic
- Role: Researcher
- Task: Research
- Best Version: **Safe Mode** (emphasizes citations)

**Why:** Mentions "research papers", needs factual accuracy

---

### Example 4: PhD Student
**Your Prompt:**
```
"Evaluate the methodology in this study about transformer models"
```

**Auto-Detected:**
- Domain: ML/Data Science
- Role: Researcher
- Task: Critical Analysis
- Best Version: **Critical Thinking** (questions assumptions)

**Why:** "Evaluate", "methodology" suggests critical analysis

---

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### ✅ DO:
- **Be clear about what you want**: "Explain...", "Help me...", "I need..."
- **Include context**: "I'm a beginner...", "For my research...", "I'm debugging..."
- **Mention your goal**: What you're trying to accomplish
- **Use natural language**: Write like you're talking to a person

### ❌ DON'T:
- Don't use just 2-3 words (too vague to detect)
- Don't mix multiple unrelated topics
- Don't include code snippets in Quick Mode (use Advanced Mode)
- Don't worry about perfect grammar (AI fixes it!)

---

## 📊 Quality Improvement

Quick Mode doesn't just make prompts faster—it makes them **better**:

### Original Prompt (Example):
```
"Tell me about machine learning"
```
**Score: 45/100**
- ❌ Too vague
- ❌ No context
- ❌ No output format
- ❌ Missing knowledge level

### Quick Mode Output (Tutor Version):
```
"I'd like to learn about machine learning. I have basic programming
knowledge but no ML experience.

Could you:
1. Explain the core concept in simple terms
2. Provide a real-world example
3. Walk me through how a basic algorithm works
4. Suggest next steps for deeper learning

Please use analogies and ask me questions to check my understanding
as we go."
```
**Score: 75/100** (+30 points!)
- ✅ Clear objective
- ✅ Context provided
- ✅ Structured request
- ✅ Specifies learning style
